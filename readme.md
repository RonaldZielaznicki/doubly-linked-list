## What is this?

`doubly-linked-list` is a [doubly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) implementation.

## API
`doubly-linked-list` mimics the API of of a [native JS array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) API as much as it can. However it only implements a subset of those methods.
